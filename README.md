# rina-iOS-posting

Use case:  Making tweet-like posts for when I am away from my computer, but still feel compelled to let the internet know about an inane thought I had.

Bonus: Add the shortcut to your homescreen!  Who needs an Apple Developer account?

Setup on iPhone (in Shortcuts app) below.  Other scripts are available in this repo.  `mobileposting.py` adds the psycopg2 tuple to a txt file, so that I can update my local database I use for keeping a backup.
